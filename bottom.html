<H2 ALIGN ="CENTER"><FONT COLOR ="DAA520">Did you know more than three million of people have already made the switch to solar power at home?</FONT></H2>
 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR ="483D8B">Unfortunately, this surge of interest in solar power has led to a lot of misleading advertising and even some   outright scams from companies selling solar installations. But if you’re interested in harnessing solar power at your home or business—and just want the facts—SOLAR FOLK IS HERE TO HELP.</FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN ="CENTER"><FONT COLOR ="DAA520">Is the Sun Going to Solve Your Efficiency Problem?</FONT></H2>

 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR ="483D8B">It might seem crazy but it’s true: The amount of sunlight that hits the earth’s surface in just an hour-and-a-half represents enough energy to power the world for an entire year. That’s power worth harnessing, right?</FONT></P>

 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR ="483D8B">Usually, solar technologies convert sunlight into electric energy through photovoltaic (PV) panels—the kind you see on rooftops or big solar arrays. When the sun shines on a solar panel, photons from the sunlight are absorbed by the panel’s cells, creating an electric field across the layers and causing electricity to flow.</FONT></P>
